# chatroom


This a socket chatroom service made in python
# steps
 # server
   1)server needs to be ran through python3.6.1 https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/python-3.6.1-amd64.exe

   2)to edit the secret admin name edit line 1 of info.chat
   
   3) edit port through line 2 of info.chat
 # client
   1)the client can be run easily(if your original server is running on a different pc edit the ip on line 2 in save.chat      https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ )

   1)default port is 25565 but can be changed in line 2 of save.chat

   2)give your friends the 2 client files(client.exe and save.chat)

# notes
1)this is a tcp based server-client system(this means both need to be online to work)

2)the system is limited so dont overload it(unless you have a beastly server)

3) you can get your public ip by typing "whats my ip" on google.com
